# AssurityTechnicalAssessment

To run the application:

1) Download the python file and the API.json file (The API.json file holds the API call that needs to be checked) 
2) Run the command 'python Assurity.py API.json'

Note: Assurity.py takes a file path as the first argument so the above command only works if the files are in the same working directory. If not then please specify the path to the API.json file.
